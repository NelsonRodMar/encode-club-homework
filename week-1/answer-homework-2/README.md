## HomeWork2

This is a simple repos to complete the HomeWork2 of the [Encode Club Expert Solidity Bootcamp](https://www.encode.club/expert-solidity-bootcamp).
You can find the instruction in the PDF file [here](../Homework2.pdf), and this solution assume that we delete one element of the array at a time. 
So it's impossible to pass an array of index to delete.

## Usage

### Install

```shell
$ forge install
```

### Build
